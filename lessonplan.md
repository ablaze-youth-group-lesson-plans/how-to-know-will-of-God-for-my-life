# What is God's will for my life?

1. write down what specific area that you wish God would tell you His will about
1. Ask everyone to submit their answers, write answers on chart paper

## Questions:

- Was there a time where someone said something, that when you heard it, you knew it came from God?
  (i.e. they could not have possibly known what they said)
- Have any of you felt the Holy Spirit prompting you to talk to a friend about Jesus or do something that may seem awkward?

#### Tell my story of how when I really wanted something and it turned out God said no, I think God was testing me with the question: do you really want me for me, or do you want me for my benefits/what i can provide you?

## Question

- So if there is "the one" person to marry, or the "correct career" -- where do you think you got that idea from?

## Conclusion:

- How many of you think God's will is like a bullseye target?
- Does it cause you anxiety and fear if you don't go on the right path?

However, notice those feelings of anxiety/fear is opposite of what God wants for you which is living in freedom and joy
(but still living according to His moral principles). If "Fear not" is the most mentioned commandment, then in your freedom, make a wise decision
knowing God is with you and will direct your paths.
